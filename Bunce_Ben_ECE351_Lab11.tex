\section{Introduction}
Using Pythons built in functions, and a function developed by Christopher Felton, a discrete system is analyzed and plots are generated.

\section{Equations}
\\Function: $y[k] = 2x[k] - 40x[k-1] + 10y[k-1] - 16y[k-2]$
\\
\\Task 1 Derivation: $H(z) = \frac{2z(z-20)}{(z-2)(z-8)}$
\\
\\Task 2 Derivation: $h[k] = 6*2^k - 4*8^k$


\section{Methodology}
First, the transfer function H(z) is found for the equation given. This transfer function is then broken apart into simpler terms and rewritten using partial fraction expansion. This was done to get the function in a form that can be transformed. Once in this form, the h[k] transform is found. Then, using the 'sig.residuez()' function, the transfer function is plugged in to verify that it matches the partial fraction expansion.

\\Next, the 'zplane' function written by Christopher Felton, is used to obtain the pole-zero plot for the transfer function H(z). 

\\Finally, the 'sig.freqz()' function is used to plot the magnitude and phase responses of H(z).


\section{Results}
Part 1
\\Task 3 Output - PFD Verification:
\\
\\ \includegraphics[width=3in]{residuez.PNG}
\\
\\ Task 4 Output - zplane func:
\\
\\ \includegraphics[width=3in]{t4.PNG}
\\
\\ Task 5 Output - freqz func:
\\
\\ \includegraphics[width=3in]{t5.png}



\section{Questions}

\textbf{Looking at the plot generated in Task 4, is H(z) stable? Explain why or why not.}
\\
\\The plot of the transfer function H(z) is unstable. This is because it goes off to infinity in both directions. Also, in the equation $A(p_1)^k + B(p_2)^k$, both $p_1$ and $p_2$ are greater than one.

\section{Conclusion}
In this lab, a transfer function was found for a given function, and then the z-transform was found for the transfer function. Then, a zplane function was used to obtain the pole-zero plot for the transfer function. The 'sig.freq' function was then also used to plot the magnitude and phase responses of H(z). These plots turned out as expected given the transfer function, and showed an unstable transfer function.

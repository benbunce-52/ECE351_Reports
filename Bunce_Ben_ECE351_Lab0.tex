\section{Questions}

1. What did you do over last summer, or what are you planning to do this upcoming summer? 
\\ \\Over the summer I spent most of my time working. I got an internship at Avista Utilities so I got to work there which was a great experience. Next summer I will most likely continue working there and hopefully take a trip out to New Jersey to see some relatives.
\\ \\2. What do you personally want to get out of this lab? 
 \\ \\I hope to gain a better understanding of python and how it can be used for the math side of electrical engineering.

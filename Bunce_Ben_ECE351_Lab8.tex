\section{Introduction}
Using python, the Fourier series of a square wave is found and then plotted for a number of N values.

\section{Equations}
\\$w = \frac{2\pi}{T}$
\\
\\$a_k = 0$
\\
\\$b_k = 2[\frac{1-cos(\pi k)}{\pi k}]$
\\
\\$a_0 = 0$
\\
\\$x(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [\frac{2(1-cos(\pi k))sin(kwt)}{\pi k}]$



\section{Methodology}
First, the equations found in the prelab are inputted into python. In python, multiple n values are inputted into the equations and the outputs are printed. Next, the Fourier series function is plotted for $N = {1,3,15,50,150,1500}$, with $T=8s$.

\section{Questions}

\textbf{1. Is x(t) an even or odd function? Explain}
\\x(t) is an even function because x(-t) = -x(t), which is defined as an even function.
\\
\\ \textbf{2. Based on results from Task 1, what do you expect a1, a2, ..., an to be?}
\\All values of $a_n$ will be equal to 0. This is because for odd function, $a_n = 0$ for all values.
\\
\\ \textbf{3. How does the approximation of the square wave change as the value of N increases? In what way does the Fourier series struggle to approximate the square wave}
\\As the value of N increases, the approximation of the square wave gets more accurate. The Fourier series struggles to approximate the square wave at low N values, where the wave turns out inaccurate.
\\
\\ \textbf{4. What is occurring mathematically in the Fourier series summation as the value of N increases?}
\\As N increases, the number of times the Fourier series is added increases, which leads to greater accuracy of the Fourier series.

\section{Conclusion}
In this lab, python was used to generate plots of the Fourier series approximation of a square wave. In the plots, it is shown that as the N value increases, the accuracy of the approximation increases, to the point where, at $N = 1500$, the Fourier series looked identical to the square wave function.
